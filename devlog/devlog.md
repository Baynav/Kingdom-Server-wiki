👑 Kingdoms — Development Update
The Engine Is Alive

We’ve crossed a huge milestone in development.

Kingdoms is no longer just an idea or design document — the core simulation is now running in-game.

Here’s what that means 👇

🏰 You Can Create a Kingdom

Players are now able to:

Establish their own kingdom

Receive a persistent capital

Log off and come back to find everything exactly where it should be

No resets. No progress loss.

Your kingdom is part of a living world.

👷 Your People Work For You

Kingdoms are powered by NPC workers who:

Gather resources over time

Consume food to survive

Struggle if supplies run low

This introduces real strategy and planning instead of simple grinding.

🌲 A Real Economy Exists

We now have active production for:

Wood

Stone

Food

Resources grow automatically through your workforce and infrastructure.

🧱 Buildings Matter

You can invest in development through structures that:

Improve efficiency

Enhance expeditions

Shape how your kingdom grows

Even at this early stage, choices already influence outcomes.

🧭 Expeditions Are Live

One of our biggest systems is now functioning.

You can send out expeditions that:

🕒 take real time
🍞 cost supplies
🎲 carry risk
💰 return with rewards
💥 can fail
🔁 continue working through server restarts

When they return, you are notified immediately.

🌍 Persistent World Confirmed

We tested:

✔ restarts
✔ shutdowns
✔ mid-expedition saves
✔ player offline completions

Everything resumes correctly.


🧠 Built For The Future


🚀 Where We’re Headed

Now that the foundation is stable, development can accelerate toward:

Physical Buildings

Not just commands but interaction with your kingdom

UI Updates

and much more to come, can't spoil it all in 1 update.

The world will soon begin to feel alive.

More updates soon 👑
