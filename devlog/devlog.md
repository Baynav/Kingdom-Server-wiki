# 👑 Kingdoms — Development Update  
## **The Engine Is Alive**

We’ve crossed a massive milestone.

**Kingdoms is no longer just a concept or design document — the core simulation is now running live in-game.**

Below is what that means for the future of the world 👇

---

## 🏰 Kingdom Creation Is Real

Players can now:

- Establish their own kingdom  
- Receive a **persistent** capital  
- Leave the server and return to find everything exactly where it should be  

> No resets.  
> No lost progress.  
> Your kingdom exists in a living, continuous world.

## 👷 Your People Work For You

Your kingdom is powered by NPC workers who:

- Gather resources automatically over time  
- Consume food to survive  
- Enter hardship if supplies run low  

This transforms gameplay from grinding → into **management, planning, and leadership**.

---

## 🌲 A Living Economy Exists

Production is now active for:

- **Wood**  
- **Stone**  
- **Food**

Resources flow through your population and infrastructure — not just player labor.

The simulation has begun.

## 🧱 Buildings Now Matter

Investment and development are meaningful.

Structures can:

- Improve efficiency  
- Strengthen expeditions  
- Influence how your kingdom grows  

Even in early development, strategic choices already create different outcomes.

---

## 🧭 Expeditions Are Operational

One of our largest systems is now online.

Players can launch expeditions that:

- 🕒 take real time  
- 🍞 cost supplies  
- 🎲 involve risk  
- 💰 return with rewards  
- 💥 sometimes fail  
- 🔁 **continue running even through server restarts**

When they return, the kingdom is updated automatically and the player is notified.

This is the first true step toward grand-strategy gameplay.

## 🌍 Persistence Confirmed

We stress-tested the system across:

- ✔ server restarts  
- ✔ shutdowns  
- ✔ mid-expedition saves  
- ✔ players being offline during completion  

Everything resumes correctly.

**The world remembers what happened.**

---

## 🧠 Built With Expansion In Mind

The most important success:

The backend is now strong enough to support major future features **without needing rewrites**.

This opens the door for things like:

- physical locations  
- steward NPC interaction  
- deeper progression  
- large-scale conflict  
- diplomacy  
- world events  

The engine can carry the weight.

## 🚀 Where We’re Headed Next

With the foundation stable, development can now accelerate toward:

- **Physical buildings instead of command-driven systems**  
- More immersive ways to interact with your kingdom  
- UI improvements  
- New strategic layers  

…and more that we’re not ready to reveal yet 👀

The world will soon begin to feel truly alive.
