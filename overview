# Kingdom Server – Overview

This server is a **persistent, no-reset kingdom simulation** built inside Minecraft.

You don’t grind personal progression endlessly.
You build a kingdom that leaves a permanent mark on the world.

## Core Ideas
- The world never resets
- Kingdoms are the primary identity
- NPCs run the economy
- Wars don’t delete progress
- History matters

## The Core Gameplay Loop
1. Found a kingdom
2. Assign NPC workers
3. Expand infrastructure
4. Engage in war, diplomacy, and exploration
5. Leave a historical legacy

## Solo & Small Groups
Solo and duo players are fully viable.
Systems normalize efficiency to prevent large groups from overwhelming smaller ones.

## World Integrity
The world is preserved:
- No strip mining
- No terrain griefing
- No permanent destruction through war

All meaningful change is system-driven.
